# OKD Tekton-Dashboard
This repository provides utilities to help automate the tekton-dashboard installation for OKD systems. Please note this repository has been only been tested on RHEL7 VMs AND assumes `subscription-manager` has been appropriately configured. To use these scripts, you must update the `$DOCKER_USERNAME` and `$DOCKER_PASSWORD` parameters within `env.sh` file as the tekton-dashboard uses ko and will publish to your dockerhub account. You will be prompted for these variables if you do not specify them. Specific to OKD installation, you may also optionally update the `$USERNAME` and `$PASSWORD` variables, which correspond to your OKD login credentials. These OKD credentials are stored at `$HTPASSWD_FILE`. If the values are not provided, you will be prompted.

### Install OKD and Dashboard
To install OKD, run the `rhel-prepare.sh` file to ensure you have the necessary prequisites followed by the `rhel-okd-install.sh` for OKD install. The prepare script will reboot the VM so you will need to wait a moment to ssh back to run the installer. At the end of OKD installation script, `dashboard-install.sh` is automatically executed to install the dashboard.

### Install Dashboard AND Prequisite Operators
If you already have OKD installed and just want to install the tekton-dashboard, you can run `dashboard-install.sh`. This script assumes that you do not have Knative/Istio/OLM/Tekton installed, behavior is undefined/unknown otherwise.
